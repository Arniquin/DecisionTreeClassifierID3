# Decision Tree Classifier with ID3 Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements a decision tree classifier using the ID3 algorithm. It allows for training a decision tree from a dataset, testing its accuracy, and classifying new examples. Synthetic data generation and tree visualization are also supported.

## Features
- Builds a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm.
- Classifies examples and evaluates accuracy.
- Generates synthetic data for additional testing.
- Visualizes the decision tree structure.
- Calculates entropy and information gain.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy
